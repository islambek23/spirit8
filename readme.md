__ ** Summary: ** __

My name is Islambek. Now I am learning how to build websites. I would like to become front-end developer.
My main aim is to start working in a software development company in a position as junior Front-end developer.
Mad devs is one of the priorities because I think they are growing very fast and they like to contribute to yout future, I mean they will do everything so that you will reach good results.
Also, I am thinking of to start freelancing in such freelance places as fl.ru and later on upwork.
Upwork is the most possible option what I will choose later. Earning 10$+ in an hour is a best option.
The most important thing for me is to become well known front developer in the world.

__ ** Skills: ** __

For the time being I am good at HTML and CSS. But I am still on my way to increase my skills in this area.
After of course I will start learning Javascript to be able to construct full working websites with it's all possibilities.

__ ** Code examples: ** __

 <form action="#">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-4 offset-2">
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="name">Name</label>
                        <input type="text" name="name" id="name">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="col-4">
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="email">Email</label>
                        <input type="email" name="email" id="email">
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="col-8 offset-2">
                    <div class="form-group">
                        <label for="message">Message</label>
                        <textarea name="message" id="message" cols="30" rows="5"></textarea>
                    </div>
                    <button class="form-button">send</button>
                </div>
            </div>

        </form>


__ ** Experience: ** __

As I already mentioned before I am studying now at It-run academy. 
Till this days I build some websites in order to be in my own collection of portfolio.
So when I start sending my resume for intance to Mad devs I already will have some works done by me what of course will increase my value as a candidate.

__ ** Education: ** __

I am graduated from Turkish "Manas" univercity. Have attented several
courses like how to be good manager, this was due to my work as sales manager, later when I become high level manager they started to send me to such courses.
Now I think that this is not important because I am willing to change my profession.

__ ** English: ** __

My english well, but because of lack of practice I started to forget what it is.
