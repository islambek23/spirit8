_**Summary:**_

My name is Islambek. Now I am learning how to build websites. I would like to become front-end developer.
My main aim is to start working in a software development company in a position as junior Front-end developer.
Mad devs is one of the priorities because I think they are growing very fast and they like to contribute to yout future, I mean they will do everything so that you will reach good results.
Also, I am thinking of to start freelancing in such freelance places as fl.ru and later on upwork.
Upwork is the most possible option what I will choose later. Earning 10$+ in an hour is a best option.
The most important thing for me is to become well known front developer in the world.

_**Skills:**_

For the time being I am good at HTML and CSS. But I am still on my way to increase my skills in this area.
After of course I will start learning Javascript to be able to construct full working websites with it's all possibilities.

_**Code examples:**_
```html
  <div class="col-lg-3 col-md-3 col-sm-6">
                        <div class="works-item">
                            <img src="./images/Layer%2082.png" class="w-100 portfolio-image" alt="">
                            <div class="overlay">
                                <h4 class="overlay-title">Trend And Fashion</h4>
                                <p class="overlay-description">Website Design</p>
                                <a href="#">
                                    <div class="overlay-icon">

_**Experience:**_

As I already mentioned before I am studying now at It-run academy. 
Till this days I build some websites in order to be in my own collection of portfolio.
So when I start sending my resume for intance to Mad devs I already will have some works done by me what of course will increase my value as a candidate.

_**Education:**_

I am graduated from Turkish "Manas" univercity. Have attented several
courses like how to be good manager, this was due to my work as sales manager, later when I become high level manager they started to send me to such courses.
Now I think that this is not important because I am willing to change my profession.

Basically I started to learn programming with Java and later come to Javascript.

Java | Front-end
------------ | -------------
From November 2018 till February 2019 | From November 2019 till present 
Good experience, but I was not able to finish because of I am lazy| I like everything for the time being, we will see what I will say when we will start learning Javascript

_**English:**_

My english well, but because of lack of practice I started to forget what it is.

As me teacher said:

> If you wanna talk go to the coridor talk and talk.
